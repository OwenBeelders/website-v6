      <description>What is seriation?The verb seriate denotes the arrangement of items in a sequence according to a prescribed criterion.
Seriation is a standard method of dating in archeology, i.e. assemblages or artifacts from numerous sites in the same culture are placed in chronological order.
In psychology, seriation is part of Piaget’s theory of cognitive development: during the Concrete Operational Stage of development a child develops the ability to sort objects or situations according to their characteristic.</description>

      <description>Data for NYCThe New York City Department of Health publishes its coronavirus data on github. The repository includes detailed information on the data sets and the definitions of the variables within the data. Our interest is in the zip code data: how virulent is the virus within our neighborhood?
The files “data-by-modzcta.csv” contain data on cases and deaths by cumulative count and rate, population, percentage of people tested positive and the number of people tested for each modified ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA).</description>

      <description>After much trial-and-error, I found that the following steps worked best for me on a Windows machine once my github account had been set up:
Run through Chapters 1 - 14 of happygitwithr.com and ensure that RStudio can connect to your github account.Implement chapter 15 of happygitwithr.com. Chapter 15 shows you how to set up a github folder for your site, clone it and open the R project for the site in the cloned directory.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
